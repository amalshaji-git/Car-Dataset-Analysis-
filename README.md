# Car Dataset Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a car dataset using various machine learning models and statistical techniques. The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize the data, as well as perform predictive modeling to uncover insights about mileage, pricing, fuel types, and more. The analysis includes both regression and classification tasks, as well as clustering for market segmentation.

## Project Objectives
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and correlations.
- Use linear regression to predict car mileage based on various features.
- Apply classification models to classify cars by price range, brand, and fuel type.
- Perform clustering to segment the market for better customer targeting.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- **data/**: Contains the car dataset in CSV format.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **output/**: Saved models, results, and visualizations.

## Key Features and Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering to create meaningful variables for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations to understand distributions and relationships between variables.
   - Heatmaps and correlation matrices to identify multicollinearity.

3. **Modeling**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Predicts car mileage based on features like engine size, horsepower, and weight.
   - **Random Forest Classification**: Classifies cars by price range and brand.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Predicts the probability of fuel types (e.g., diesel, petrol).
   - **Decision Trees**: Classifies car owner types based on user-defined categories.
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Segments the car market based on customer characteristics.

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - Analyzed feature importance using Random Forest to understand the main factors influencing each target variable.

5. **Market Segmentation**:
   - Used K-means clustering to group cars into different market segments, helping in targeted marketing strategies.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Manipulation: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
  - Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
  - Clustering: `KMeans` from `scikit-learn`

## Results
- Created regression and classification models with satisfactory accuracy, predicting car attributes effectively.
- Developed insights into feature importance, which provided actionable data on how each attribute impacts the target variables.
- Clustering results revealed distinct market segments, offering potential strategies for customer targeting.

## Challenges
